[what3words][words] is the simplest way to talk about any precise location. This
system has divided the world into a grid of three meters by three meters squares
and assigned each one a unique address made of just 3 words. Now everyone and
everywhere has a reliable address.

With this library, you can create HTTP requests that will convert three-word
addresses to latitude, longitude coordinates and vice-versa.

To use this library, you will need [the core HTTP library][http] and have an
understanding on how to use `Cmd`s.
